description: 'This dataset contains recordings of single-unit activity from globus
  pallidus-internus (GPi) in monkeys performing a choice reaction time reaching task.
  It contains data from two monkeys before and after the administration of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine),
  which induces Parkinsonism. The neuronal activity was recorded using 16-contact
  linear probes (0.5–1.0 MΩ, V-probe, Plexon) or glass-insulated tungsten microelectrodes
  (0.5–1.5 MΩ, Alpha Omega). The neuronal data were amplified (4×, 2 Hz–7.5 kHz) and
  digitized at 24.414 kHz (approx., 16-bit resolution; Tucker Davis Technologies).
  The neuronal data were high-pass filtered (Fpass: 200 Hz, Matlab FIRPM) and thresholded,
  and candidate action potentials were sorted into clusters in principal components
  space (Off-line Sorter, Plexon).


  The recordings for subject Isis before the administration of MPTP (pre-MPTP) were
  collected by Daisuke Kase.

  The recordings for subject Isis after the administration of MPTP (post-MPTP) were
  collected by Yan Han (韩妍).

  The recordings for subject Gaia (pre-MPTP,  post-MPTP) from 2015 were collected
  by Andrew J. Zimnik.

  The recordings for subject Gaia (pre-MPTP,  post-MPTP) from 2016-2017 were also
  collected by Daisuke Kase.'
